Definition of UX design

-Research ⇒ Collect information to know what users mainly occupy. It is good to rely on existing applications to create a good UX design.

-Analysis ⇒ Once the information is collected, it is analyzed and the important points that we must take into account when creating the design are obtained.

-Design ⇒ Prototypes or sketches are created to visualize the result.

-User testing ⇒ Generally, they are carried out in sketches to make adjustments before taking the design to code.
