## Creative Process

- *(Investigation)* Olga needs to make a birthday cake. Before starting, she creates an inventory list and explores a few recipes.
- *(Experimentation/Incubation)* After investigating, Olga realizes that all cake recipes require an oven. She focuses on finding recipes that do not require an oven.
- *(Illumination)* After considering several options, she decides to create a strawberry cheesecake.
- *(Evaluation)* Before starting, she realizes that she doesn't have enough inventory, so she decides to make one with grapes instead.
- *(Implementation)* Once everything is ready, Olga prepares a wonderful birthday cheesecake!
